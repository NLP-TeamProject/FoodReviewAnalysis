Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis on a dataset of reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The code is written in Python and uses popular libraries such as Pandas, NLTK, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.

Project Structure
SentimentAnalysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for sentiment analysis.
foods.txt: Text file containing the raw review data.
README.md: Documentation providing an overview of the project.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

Open SentimentAnalysis.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., Google Colab).
Upload Dataset:

Ensure that the foods.txt file is available in the specified path.
Run the Notebook:

Execute the cells in the notebook to load the data, perform preprocessing, train machine learning models, and visualize results.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
NLTK
BeautifulSoup
Scikit-Learn
Wordcloud
Data Preprocessing
Raw reviews are loaded from the foods.txt file and organized into a Pandas DataFrame.
The dataset is cleaned, and features such as helpfulness ratio and percentage upvotes are calculated.
Sentiment Analysis
NLTK and VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer are used for sentiment analysis.
Text preprocessing involves removing stopwords, cleaning, and stemming.
Machine Learning Models
Naive Bayes Classifier
Multinomial Naive Bayes model is trained on the Bag-of-Words representation of the text data.
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy and a classification report.
Logistic Regression Model
Logistic Regression model is trained on the Bag-of-Words representation with stop words removal.
Model performance is evaluated similarly.
Visualization
Visualizations include bar plots, histograms, word clouds, and scatter plots to provide insights into sentiment distribution, review lengths, and relationships between helpful votes and review scores.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of sentiment analysis and machine learning models to analyze and classify reviews. Feel free to experiment with different models, hyperparameters, or extend the analysis to meet your specific needs.
