This repository contains a Python script for sentiment analysis and review classification based on user reviews from a text dataset. The script utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze sentiments and predict review ratings.

# FoodReviewAnalysis_Group4

The Food Review Analysis Project is a data-driven analysis that leverages sentiment analysis and text summarization techniques in Python to gain insights from a large corpus of food reviews.
This project aims to extract valuable information from textual data, providing valuable insights into consumer preferences and restaurant performance.

Key Components of the Project:

Data Collection:
Gathering a diverse dataset of food reviews from various sources, such as social media, review websites, or APIs.
Preprocessing the data to remove noise, including HTML tags, special characters, and irrelevant information.

Sentiment Analysis:
Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or TextBlob to conduct sentiment analysis on the reviews.
Determining the sentiment of each review as positive, negative, or neutral.
Calculating sentiment scores or polarities to quantify the sentiment strength.

Text Summarization:
Applying text summarization techniques, such as extractive or abstractive summarization, to condense the lengthy reviews into concise summaries.
Utilizing libraries or Transformers to generate summaries that capture the essential information.

Visualization and Insights:
Creating visualizations, such as word clouds, sentiment distributions, and summary statistics, to provide a holistic view of the data.
Extracting meaningful insights from the sentiment and summarization results, including identifying common positive and negative aspects of the reviewed foods.
